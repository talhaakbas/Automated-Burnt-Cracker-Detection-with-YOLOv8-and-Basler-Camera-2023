# Automated-Burnt-Cracker-Detection-with-YOLOv8-and-Basler-Camera-2023
This project uses a Basler camera and YOLOv8 model to detect burnt cracker sticks on a production line. The camera captures images, which are processed by the model to classify crackers as burnt or normal. The system automates quality control, improving efficiency, consistency, and accuracy while reducing human error.
